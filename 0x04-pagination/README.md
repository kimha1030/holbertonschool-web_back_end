## Learning Objectives

- How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

## Tasks

### [0. Simple helper function](0-simple_helper_function.py)

Write a function named index_range that takes two integer arguments page and page_size.

The function should return a tuple of size two containing a start index and an end index corresponding to the range of indexes to return in a list for those particular pagination parameters.

Page numbers are 1-indexed, i.e. the first page is page 1.

### [1. Simple pagination](1-simple_pagination.py)

Implement a method named get_page that takes two integer arguments page with default value 1 and page_size with default value 10.

You have to use this CSV file (same as the one presented at the top of the project)
Use assert to verify that both arguments are integers greater than 0.
Use index_range to find the correct indexes to paginate the dataset correctly and return the appropriate page of the dataset (i.e. the correct list of rows).
If the input arguments are out of range for the dataset, an empty list should be returned.

### [2. Hypermedia pagination](2-hypermedia_pagination.py)

Replicate code from the previous task.

Implement a get_hyper method that takes the same arguments (and defaults) as get_page and returns a dictionary containing the following key-value pairs:

- page_size: the length of the returned dataset page
- page: the current page number
- data: the dataset page (equivalent to return from previous task)
- next_page: number of the next page, None if no next page
- prev_page: number of the previous page, None if no previous page
- total_pages: the total number of pages in the dataset as an integer
  Make sure to reuse get_page in your implementation.

### [3. Deletion-resilient hypermedia pagination](3-hypermedia_del_pagination.py)

The goal here is that if between two queries, certain rows are removed from the dataset, the user does not miss items from dataset when changing page.
Implement a get_hyper_index method with two integer arguments: index with a None default value and page_size with default value of 10.

The method should return a dictionary with the following key-value pairs:

- index: the current start index of the return page. That is the index of the first item in the current page. For example if requesting page 3 with page_size 20, and no data was removed from the dataset, the current index should be 60.
- next_index: the next index to query with. That should be the index of the first item after the last item on the current page.
- page_size: the current page size
- data: the actual page of the dataset
